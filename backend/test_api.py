Test script to verify the paperly API workflow.

This script tests the complete workflow:
1. Get a pre-signed upload URL from GET /papers/upload_url
2. Upload a PDF file to the presigned URL
3. Create an analysis task at POST /analyses/
4. Poll the analysis status every 5 seconds until status becomes "markdown_extracted"
